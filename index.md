# Fluid Simulation via the Affine Particle-in-Cell Method

## Summary

We intend to design a fluid simulator based on the affine particle-in-cell method. To ensure realism of the simulations, we also intend to render the fluid point-clouds via surface splatting techniques.

## Problem

Fluid simulation is an active field of research, and developing fluids with realistic fluid properties is useful in applications ranging from reasearch into complex ecological systems via simulation to the beautification of contemporary gaming. High fidelity physical properties can be especially important in research, where the results are often dependent on the assumption that the simulation is faithful to some degree to the real scene. The challenge in designing such a simulation methods comes from faithfully representing the fluid to retain its physical properties without introducing excessive assumptions or noise. 

To provide such a simulation, we turn to the APIC (Affine Particle-in-Cell) method, which builds on the PIC (Particle-in-Cell) and FLIP (Fluid-Implicit Particle) methods to produce a provably more stable simulation that has much lower energy dissipation between steps.
