## Fluid Simulation via the Affine Particle-in-Cell Method

### Summary

We intend to design a fluid simulator based on the affine particle-in-cell method. To ensure realism of the simulations, we also intend to render the fluid point-clouds via surface splatting techniques.

### Problem

Fluid simulation is an active field of research, and developing fluids with realistic fluid properties is useful in applications ranging from reasearch into complex ecological systems via simulation to the beautification of contemporary gaming. High fidelity physical properties can be especially important in research, where the results are often dependent on the assumption that the simulation is faithful to some degree to the real scene. The challenge in designing such a simulation methods comes from faithfully representing the fluid to retain its physical properties without introducing excessive assumptions or noise. 

To provide such a simulation, we turn to the APIC (Affine Particle-in-Cell) method, which builds on the PIC (Particle-in-Cell) and FLIP (Fluid-Implicit Particle) methods to produce a provably more stable simulation that has much lower energy dissipation between steps.

### Goals and Deliverables





## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/alishelton/184-project-proposal/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/alishelton/184-project-proposal/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
